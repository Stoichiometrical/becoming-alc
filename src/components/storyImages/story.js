    let arasen ="My odyssey so far at ALC has been quite flavourful with a lot of twists and turns. But yet as the tagline of our university says: \" Do hard things and have fun\", that is how life has been dealt with so far. Let us dive deeper and uncover my journey.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "First and foremost, let me introduce myself; my name is Arasen Parmanum and I am a Mauritian. During my high school years, I attended a robotics bootcamp at ALC and since then the environment has left an impression on me so I have decided to apply as soon as I am done with my studies.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "In 2020, I received my admission decision from the ALC team after waiting for some endless months. The happiness was at its peak when I learnt that I was admitted and then it skyrocketed after I saw that I even earned a scholarship. After that moment, the only feelings were the impatience and excitement of getting to ALC.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Even though the wait was long, we had PAVE which gave us an opportunity to have a taste of what was awaiting us when we got to campus, but then the time flew and we quickly reached the awaited moment to reach campus. This month was packed with emotions and all kinds of activities to initiate us into the campus environment. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "The upcoming months got even better and better since I personally had the privilege of meeting people from all over Africa and connecting with them. ALC also helped me in truly finding my career path and the mission that I wish to accomplish. The aspect that even helped the most was the fact that I had gotten friends who have the same vision as me, hence we were able to work together towards our objective.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "On an endnote, my advice to prospective students would be to take your chance and apply. Be daring and make the leap towards joining an institute with an innovative mindset that has so many resources to help you in fulfilling your goal in life.\n"

I was doing online courses in line with digital marketing and basic coding skills because I wanted to major in Computer Science. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "My father learned about ALU via an advertisement while working from home online. It was during the global epidemic, and the internet was our only gateway to the outside world. He promptly informed me of the incredible opportunity, which was initially frightening, but I soon began researching the university and the vast variety of prospects available to me as a result of its prestigious evaluations and achievements. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "To be honest, I was initially apprehensive about studying outside of my own country since I dread change. My parents actually warmed me up to the process and walked me through the diverse opportunities and experiences I would acquire. True to their word, my ALU journey has been one of the most authentic and eye-opening experiences of my life. The application procedure was both seamless and demanding while yet being simple and convenient. They wanted me to explore my entrepreneurial side and my ideas and thought process for how I might add value to our African community, which was intriguing. Before we formally arrived on campus, the institution offered an introductory course called PAVE that gave us a taste of the university dynamic. An integrated curriculum is used which ties together diverse areas of study by cutting across subject lines and highlighting common themes. Integration focuses on establishing links for students, allowing participation in relevant, meaningful activities relevant to their everyday lives.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Relocating was challenging for me at first, but with time and the company I kept, I was able to develop a new sense of home on the island. The opportunity to interact with a varied and diverse group of students has been the most rewarding aspect of my trip. I've always wanted to travel overseas, but had never recognized the actual richness of African culture and the inclusive environment that ALU fosters.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The best advice I would give to prospective students would be to be open-minded and eager to build themselves and their brand while enriching their mind with smart tactical knowledge. They should as well as continue to develop their entrepreneurial spirit alongside pursuing their degree.\n"

        "\n" +
        "ASA is a school set up with the aim of educating girls in Africa passionate about STEM. There, I had the opportunity to grow up academically and improved my intrapersonal skills such as time management, resilience, and self-discipline. I was able to move out of my comfort zone and meet ladies from different backgrounds and mindsets. This taught me how to be more open-minded. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "Moving from ASA, where I heard about the African Leadership College(ALC) was a huge step for me. Despite the recommendation by my previous institution to attend ALC, my greatest motivation to attend it was the fact that I was willing to meet new people and learn from them.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Though scared of not getting selected, I still went on with my application. My application process was facilitated by the help of amazing people I had met at ASA. Fingers crossed, I could feel goosebumps rushing through my skin as a read I was admitted. Quite funny how I keep moving between African leading institutions. That certainly reflects my desire to learn more about Africa and Africans as a whole.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "After admission, I was introduced to Cameroonians equally going to ALC. Moving to Mauritius was definitely easier, knowing that I had people to rely on and friends who quickly became family. I remember how much we were admired by other students for our Unity. Undoubtedly, ALC helped me to meet stunning people from Mauritius, Cameroon, Rwanda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania, and more. Just for the relations, I have established so far, I would advise students to apply to ALC. Additionally, the learning environment is ideal for everyone, multitaskers, slow or fast learners, and others.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Indeed, my decision to come to ALC has been one of the smartest I have ever made. I am glad and proud to say I have experienced an incredible leadership life so far. From organizing to participating in events as well as taking part in the astounding working committees such as the Catering Committee and the Student Representative Council, I appreciate it all. Can’t wait to make the most of my stay in Mauritius and ALC.\n"

I worked very hard in A-level and passed with brilliant results. Stumbled upon the African Leadership College(ALC) as l was looking for the most innovative spaces to nurture my talent and transform my dreams into goals.\n" +
        " \n" +
        "I boldly applied and got waitlisted for a full scholarship. Was surprised when the admissions team told me my application was one of the best in the current application pool. I had applied to ALC primarily because of the diversity of the campus and its location, MAURITIUSSSSSSSSS. Honestly, the main reason was the island, l wanted a place far away, where l could establish, have a tropical island lifestyle and do great things. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "I engaged with resources to familiarize with Mauritius and the ALC culture, and joined the admitted students' WhatsApp group. There, I had  insightful conversations with brilliant leaders. A lot happened between the waiting period and getting to Mauritius because of Covid-19. That was stressful, but manageable. Finally, the school squeezed to get us to Mauritius. For me, this meant staying in Rwanda for 2 weeks before reaching to the island because of some Covid-19 embargoes but in the ups and downs, I made it to ALC. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "For the past year, ALC has been amazing, it's been full of challenges and glories. I have come to like how diversity is embraced and everyone is allowed to be themselves. Not being utopic, there are always some challenges of bias from countries with a  lot more students. The most challenging part has been academics, getting used to the heavy workload and self-driven learning took a toil on me and most students. Nevertheless, once you learn to manage your time effectively and prioritize your activities, you cope very well. Being part of ALC connects you to a lot of opportunities from the African Leadership Group(ALG). Which you have to be ready for when they come around. \n" +
        "\n" +
        "To wrap up, l am happy that l came to ALC, and I am enjoying the tropical island vibes while on my way to my dream life. I  could see myself living in Mauritius for the next 10 years, the people here are very nice and there are a lot of cool places to visit. l only wish l had learned French early, but overlay it's been one of the best experiences.\n"
